		<Center><h3>CAD/CAM Dental Restoration</h3></Center>
				<hr>
				<p>Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) has been extensively utilized in a variety of manufacturing and engineering fields for decades. Now, CAD/CAM is helping revolutionize the digital dentistry world by simplifying and streamlining the creation of porcelain dental restorations.</p>
                
               <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/cad1.png" alt=""></p></Center>
            
                <p>CAD/CAM restorations tout numerous advantages for you, your dental practice and your patients alike. If you are still using traditional methods to manufacture restorations in your dental practice, these three advantages of CAD/CAM will sway you to make the switch.</p>

                <p>In some cases, a removable retainer will be all that’s necessary. In other rare cases (especially when there is an extreme overbite or underbite), surgery may be necessary. In most cases, however, braces will be needed..</p>

				<Center><h3>Turnaround time is significantly decreased.</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/cad2.jpg" alt=""></Center>

				<p>CAD/CAM technology displays 3D images of your patient’s teeth and gums, which allows you to design digital dental restorations with functional and aesthetic characteristics in mind. The dental restoration is designed on the computer and then sent to the lab where it is sculpted to the exact specifications of the design via computer-aided manufacturing. With this method, common disadvantages of traditional dental restorations (think: taking impressions, creating an uncomfortable temporary tooth, and unnecessarily reducing part of the healthy teeth) are avoided. Since the entire process is streamlined, turnaround time is significantly decreased. Rather than the traditional two to three week process, CAD/CAM can speed up turnaround time to just five days, creating a win-win situation for you and your patients.</p>

               
				<Center><h3> Improved predictability of outcomes.</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/cad3.jpeg" alt=""></Center>

				<p>CAD/CAM technology already offers improved predictability of outcomes compared to traditional dental restoration methods, and will eventually be able to offer complete predictability of outcomes through further advancements. With complete predictability of outcomes, automatic restoration designs won’t require further modifications based on patient factors. This means that factors such as wear, age, tooth conditions, TMJ disorders, and the like won’t garner unpredictable outcomes. In addition, your patients will love having their restoration’s design based on aesthetics and desired look</p>

				<Center><h3>You’ll promote safer dental restorations.</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/cad4.jpeg" alt=""></Center>

				<p>CAD/CAM dental technology utilizes sculpted porcelain to create high-quality inlays, onlays, and crowns, which promotes even safer dental restorations by avoiding the use of metal amalgam materials. This ultimately reduces exposure to trace levels of mercury and garners a result that is close to a patient’s natural enamel.</p>
