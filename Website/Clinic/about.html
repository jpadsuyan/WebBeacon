					<h1>About Stanley!</h1>
					<p>A. clutz Dental Clinic is headed by Dr.Anne Cluz, an experienced dentist of 25 years. The good doctor humbly started with one dental chair in the heart of Camp 7, Baguio City suitably located beside a talipapa or wet market. She gained her patients' trust through the years in which a quite good number of them became her steadfast friends. They often say how lucky they are to have known her as a friend and their dentist. Dr.Anne Cluz or simply called Doktora to many, is a dedicated and dynamic dentist. She earnestly explains cases to patients that sometimes one can only wonder where she gets her unending energy. Her patient's well-being is foremost in her mind when she works such that she makes sure that the final outcome satisfies her patient. Her efficiency coupled with her good natured disposition relaxes the patient's nerves which become the main reason why they keep coming back. It is not a surprised that she earned the respect of not only her patients but her co-dentists as well.


                    <p>It is not long after that DDr.Anne Cluz's clinic expanded to three dental chairs. With the customers' constant demands, she hired younger dentists to help-out. In the beginning, it seems that she needed their assistance but in the end, the novice dentists are quite lucky to have her as their mentor since she generously shares her knowledge and patiently explains solutions to dental cases. Eventually, she became their role-model, not only in their profession but also in their attitude specially to work. Learning never stops to Dr. Ferraren. In between running her clinic and taking care of her husband and son, she makes sure that she is updated with the ever changing and improvement of dental instruments. She has attended various trainings and seminars such as: cosmetic dentistry that deals with veneers and crowns, biofunctional dentistry that deals with the harmony of the muscles, jaws and teeth and implant dentistry which also deals with the esthetics of bone and gums..</p>


                    <p>With Dr.Anne Cluz's dedication and hard work, she further expanded and opened her new clinic at the heart of Makati's business district in Greenbelt, thus called Greenbelt Makati Dental Center. She constantly upgrades her equipment to with the latest trends and demands of the clients. She now has the diagnostic equipment which is the digital panoramic and cephalometric x-ray to be able to diagnose and treat the patient effectively and efficiently.</p>
