		<Center><h3>Dental Bonding</h3></Center>
				<hr>
            <p>Dental bonding is a procedure in which a tooth-colored resin material (a durable plastic material) is applied and hardened with a special light, which ultimately “bonds” the material to the tooth to restore or improve person’s smile.</p>

            <p><Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/tmj.png" alt=""></p></Center>

                <p>Many general dentists are doing basic alignment and Orthodontics, but orthodontists specialize in correcting irregularities of the teeth.</p>
                
               
				<Center><h3>Preparation</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/db1.jpg" alt=""></Center>

				<p>Little advance preparation is needed for dental bonding. Anesthesia is often not necessary unless the bonding is being used to fill a decayed tooth, the tooth needs to be drilled to change its shape, or the chip is near the nerve. Your dentist will use a shade guide to select a composite resin color that will closely match the color of your tooth.</p>

                <p>The bonding process. Next, the surface of the tooth will be roughened and a conditioning liquid applied. These procedures help the bonding material adhere to the tooth. The tooth-colored, putty-like resin is then applied, molded, and smoothed to the desired shape. A bright, usually blue, light, or laser is then used to harden the material. After the material is hardened, your dentist will further trim and shape it, and polish it to match the sheen of the rest of the tooth surface.</p>
        
                <p>Time-to-completion. Dental bonding takes about 30 to 60 minutes per tooth to complete.</p>
	
				<Center><h3>What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Dental Bonding?</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/db2.jpg" alt=""></Center>

				<p>Advantages: Dental bonding is among the easiest and least expensive of cosmetic dental procedures. Unlike veneers and crowns, which are customized tooth coverings that must be manufactured in a lab, bonding usually can be done in one office visit unless several teeth are involved. Another advantage, compared with veneers and crowns, is that the least amount of tooth enamel is removed. Also, unless dental bonding is being performed to fill a cavity, anesthesia is usually not required.</p>
                    
                <p>Disadvantages: Although the material used in dental bonding is somewhat stain resistant, it does not resist stains as well as crowns. Another disadvantage is that the bonding materials do not last as long nor are as strong as other restorative procedures, such as crowns, veneers, or fillings. Additionally, bonding materials can chip and break off the tooth.</p>

                <p>Because of some of the limitations of dental bonding, some dentists view it as best suited for small cosmetic changes, for temporary correction of cosmetic defects, and for correction of teeth in areas of very low bite pressure (for example, front teeth). Consult with your dentist about the best cosmetic approach for your particular problem.</p>

				<Center><h3>Do Bonded Teeth Require Special Care?</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/db3.jpg" alt=""></Center>

				<p>Bonded teeth do not require special care. Simply follow good oral hygiene practices. Brush teeth at least twice a day, floss at least once a day, rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash once or twice a day, and see your dentist for regular professional check-ups and cleanings.</p>

                <p>Because bonding material can chip, it is important to avoid such habits as biting fingernails; chewing on pens, ice, or other hard food objects; or using your bonded teeth as an opener. If you do notice any sharp edges on a bonded tooth or if your tooth feels odd when you bite down, call your dentist.</p>
        
				<Center><h3>How Long Does Bonding Material Last?</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/db4.jpg" alt=""></Center>

				<p>The lifespan of bonding materials for the teeth depends on how much bonding was done and your oral habits. Typically, however, bonding material lasts from three years up to about 10 years before needing to be touched up or replaced.</p>
