				<hr>
				<p>If you have crooked teeth and/or a misaligned bite (an underbite or overbite), there are a variety of treatments that can help straighten teeth, including braces and retainers.

                <p>Many general dentists are doing basic alignment and Orthodontics, but orthodontists specialize in correcting irregularities of the teeth.</i></p>
                
               <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/brace1.png" alt=""></p></Center>
            
                <p>The dentist or orthodontist you choose will ask questions about your health, conduct a clinical exam, take impressions of your teeth, take photos of your face and teeth, and order X-rays of the mouth and head. An appropriate treatment plan is made based on analysis of the gathered information.</p>

                <p>In some cases, a removable retainer will be all that’s necessary. In other rare cases (especially when there is an extreme overbite or underbite), surgery may be necessary. In most cases, however, braces will be needed..</p>

				<Center><h3>How its work</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/brace2.png" alt=""></Center>

				<p>In their entirety, braces work by applying continuous pressure over a period of time to slowly move teeth in a specific direction. As the teeth move, the bone changes shape as pressure is applied.<p/>
                
                <p>Brackets are the small squares that are bonded directly to the front of each tooth with a special dental bonding agent or are attached to orthodontic bands. Brackets act like handles, holding the arch wires that move the teeth. There are several types of brackets, including stainless steel and tooth-colored ceramic or plastic, which are often selected because they’re less obvious. Occasionally, brackets are cemented to the back of teeth, in order to hide them from view.

                <p>Orthodontic bands are stainless steel, clear, or tooth-colored materials that are cemented to the teeth with dental bonding agents. They wrap around each tooth to provide an anchor for the brackets. The clear or tooth-colored bands are more cosmetically appealing options but are more expensive than stainless steel. They are not used in all patients. Some people have only brackets and no bands.</p>

                <p>Spacers are separators that fit between teeth to create a small space prior to placement of orthodontic bands.
                Arch wires attach to the brackets and act as tracks to guide the movement of the teeth. Arch wires can be made of metal or be clear or tooth-colored.</p>

                <p>Ties are small rubber rings or fine wires that fasten the arch wire to the brackets. They can be clear, metal, or colored.</p>
                        
                <p>The dentist or orthodontist you choose will ask questions about your health, conduct a clinical exam, take impressions of your teeth, take photos of your face and teeth, and order X-rays of the mouth and head. An appropriate treatment plan is made based on analysis of the gathered information.</p>

                <p>In some cases, a removable retainer will be all that’s necessary. In other rare cases (especially when there is an extreme overbite or underbite), surgery may be necessary. In most cases, however, braces will be needed..</p>

				<Center><h3>How Long Will I Have to Wear Braces?</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/brace3.png" alt=""></Center>

				<p>The time required for braces varies from person to person, depending on the severity of the problem; the amount of room available; the distance the teeth must travel; the health of the teeth, gums, and supporting bone; and how closely the patient follows instructions. On average, however, once the braces are put on, they usually remain in place for one to three years. After braces are removed, most patients will need to wear a retainer all the time for the first six months, then only during sleep for many years</p>

				<Center><h3>Will Braces Be Painful?</h3></Center>
                <Center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work/brace4.png" alt=""></Center>

				<p>Some of the adjustments your orthodontist may make to your braces may make your mouth feel sore or uncomfortable. When needed, over-the-counter pain relievers like Motrin or Tylenol can help relieve the pain. If you always experience a lot of pain after your braces are adjusted, talk to your orthodontist about it; he or she may be able to make the adjustments a bit differently.</p>
